To the surprise of people who buy stucco houses, they learn very quickly that they are going to need to paint their home. Luckily, there is a large variety of different stucco exterior paint colors on the market today!\nBest Stucco Paint Colors: Finding Paint\nEven though stucco houses can be less work than a wood houses, they still require quite a bit of maintenance.

Updating your siding with stucco could provide just the change you need. Stucco is a mixture of cement, lime, and silica that is applied in layers over wood or metal mesh around the exterior of your home. When it dries, it forms a concrete shell around the frame of your house, protecting it from the elements and sealing the insulation. Stucco homes are often easier to heat and cool, which saves money and energy. However, there are some possible drawbacks. Consider the pros and cons of stucco installation in NJ.\nPros of Stucco Installation\nBecause stucco creates such a solid barrier, your home stays insulated from outside temperatures. The hardiness of stucco means that cracks are less likely, so the air inside your home isn\u2019t affected by the air outside. This makes stucco homes more energy efficient. Stucco also reduces the transmission of sound through the exterior walls of your home. This greatly benefits those who live in a noisy neighborhood, or across the street from a highway.\nMany homeowners have chosen stucco installation in NJ because the process is quick and the result is pleasing to the eye. Unlike the other types of home exteriors like brick or stone, stucco installation lasts only a day or two. Even though several layers need to be applied for an adequate barrier, the result is a hardy exterior that lasts for decades. Stucco is very low maintenance and is very resistant to cracks, mold, and mildew. Plus, it can be applied to both concrete and wood frame buildings.\nThe smooth, seamless appearance of stucco draws the eye to your home\u2019s other notable features, which is why it makes a great pairing with stone or brick walls. If your home has an ornate masonry wall around the front door, adding stucco to the other walls brings the focal point to that masonry. Since stucco mixtures can be any color, you won\u2019t have any trouble matching the exact tone that you need.\nCons of Stucco Installation\nChoosing stucco installation in NJ does come with a few drawbacks. Once you choose the color, it can be costly to change it after the stucco is applied. You are able to paint over stucco, however doing so would detract from the qualities that make stucco convenient.", "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:401f9194-daf3-45a9-a11d-e874cdf18530>"]}, {"passage": "Stucco siding is very commonly used in Spanish and Mediterranean architecture, and is frequently found throughout the American West (particularly the Southwest). Homes with stucco siding might have it in any number of textures, including smooth, pebbled, swirled and more, with the texture depending on the kind of application technique used for installation.\nIf you\u2019re looking at purchasing a house that already has stucco installed or are considering adding stucco to the exterior of your home, it\u2019s important to know the pros of stucco siding in Bluffton, SC so you fully understand what you\u2019re getting into. Here\u2019s an overview of what you should know about stucco and why so many people enjoy it as a form of siding.\nBenefits of stucco\nStucco remains a very popular form of siding on homes after a long history of being used in various applications and climates around the world. One of the original reasons it became so appealing was for its fire resistance, which is why you\u2019ll often find it used in homes in hot, dry climates that are more susceptible to potential wildfires. An inch-thick coating of stucco will provide a one-hour firewall rating, which means it will take at least an hour for the fire to spread from one side of the wall to the other. This gives a much larger window of time for families to safely get out of the house, and also makes it easier to meet the strict fire codes enforced in some neighborhoods.\nThere are, of course, a lot of aesthetic benefits to stucco as well. Many homeowners find stucco to be a great choice for their home simply because it creates a unique, appealing texture. You don\u2019t just have to use the standard gray or white concrete colors, either\u2014there are all kinds of hues you can create by mixing in dyes, which allows you to complement other colors on your home and around your property.\nHow stucco is applied\nThere are several methods that can be used to apply stucco. The traditional method involves a three-coat process over a wood-frame exterior. You begin with a scratch coat over a metal lath that gets attached to the exterior frame, followed by a brown coat to adhere to that rough surface. The brown coat is designed to improve strength, and act as a base for the finish coat, which is hand-troweled for a custom appearance and is what gives the stucco its aesthetically pleasing look.", "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:d84d773a-e17c-4bbc-ad6a-97845ff42181>"]}, {"passage": "Whether you\u2019re building a home for the first time or renovating the exterior of your current home, it\u2019s important to determine the best exterior style for your home. Here is a brief guide to finding the best exterior style for your home\u2014taking neighborhood, region, climate, taste, and more into account.\nConsider your home\u2019s location.\nYour home\u2019s location is going to help you make several decisions from the get-go. First, what materials are the homes in your neighborhood using? It\u2019s best to use similar materials to those used on the homes in your neighborhood for a more cohesive look. What about your region? If your home is located near large mountains, like Utah homes are with the Wasatch Mountains, you may want to consider using materials such as stucco or stone to complement your natural surroundings. And what about climate? Some materials are better than others at standing up to intense sunlight, heavy snowfall, high humidity, etc. An exterior design expert can help you find a suitably durable material for the climate in your area.\nConsider your taste.\nWith all of that said, your own taste and preferences definitely have a say in how your home should look. Do you have a favorite color that you would love to see on the outside of your home? Are you especially fond of the natural aesthetic? Would you prefer a colonial look, rustic look, or modern look for your home? An exterior design expert can help you see your options with special home visualizer software\u2014and from there you can simply let your taste decide what looks best to you.\nDon\u2019t forget that you can mix materials.\nYou don\u2019t have to decide on just siding, just stucco, or just stone for your home. Working with more than one material is a great way to give your home aesthetic interest and a dimensional look. Many homes in Utah, for example, feature both stucco and stone, making them blend in well with the surrounding landscape.
